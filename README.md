# HTML-Assignment
HTML

Your assignment is to build a basic HTML page structure, for use in later exercises. Don’t focus at all on styling at this point – only make the HTML elements and their contents.

Required Features:

• The page should be encoded using the UTF-8 character set.

• A page title, defined in the head element.

• A header element containing a heading (h1) with the page name. It should also have a nav element with an unordered list of at least 3 links.

• A container element for the main content of the page, containing a heading (h2), a paragraph of text and two article elements. Each should have filler text - at least 2 paragraphs each. One should have an image (use lorempixel.com).

• A aside element, containing a heading (h2) and an unordered list of nations, each list item containing an ordered list of the nation’s three biggest cities.

• A footer element, containing a copyright symbol and your name.
